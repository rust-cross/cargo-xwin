Cross compile Cargo project to Windows msvc target with ease using [xwin](https://github.com/Jake-Shadle/xwin) or [windows-msvc-sysroot](https://github.com/trcrsired/windows-msvc-sysroot).

**By using this software you are consented to accept the license at [https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2086102](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2086102)**

## Prerequisite

1. Install [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (On macOS run `brew install llvm` and you're good to go).
2. For assembly dependencies, install `llvm-tools` component via `rustup component add llvm-tools` or install [llvm](https://llvm.org).

A full LLVM installation is recommended to avoid possible issues.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --locked cargo-xwin
```

You can also install it using pip:

```bash
pip install cargo-xwin
```

We also provide a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/messense/cargo-xwin) which has wine pre-installed in addition to cargo-xwin and Rust,
for example to build for x86_64 Windows:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/io -w /io messense/cargo-xwin \
  cargo xwin build --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

## Usage

1. Install Rust Windows msvc target via rustup, for example, `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
2. Run `cargo xwin build`, for example, `cargo xwin build --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Run tests with wine

With wine installed, you can run tests with the `cargo xwin test` command,
for example, `cargo xwin test --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`

### Customization

The Microsoft CRT and Windows SDK can be customized using the following environment variables or CLI options.

| Environment Variable         | CLI option                     | Description                                                                                                        |

### CMake Support

Some Rust crates use the [cmake](https://github.com/alexcrichton/cmake-rs) crate to build C/C++ dependencies,
cargo-xwin will generate a [CMake toolchain](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-toolchains.7.html) file
automatically to make cross compilation work out of the box.

**[ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) is required** to enable CMake support.
